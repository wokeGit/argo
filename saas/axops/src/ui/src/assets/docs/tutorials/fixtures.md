Fixtures are resources and services that can be reserved and used in workflows. If the resource or service can be accessed remotely, it can be turned into a fixture.
There are two types of fixtures:

* Static – Preconfigured, externally managed resources (such as pools of VMs or SaaS services).
* Dynamic – A containerized service that is dynamically created during the execution of a workflow (such as a MySQL server used for testing).

You can create, manage, and view fixtures.
