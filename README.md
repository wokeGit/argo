# Argo - The Workflow Engine for Kubernetes

![Argo Image](argo.png)

## What is Argo?
Argo is an open source container-native workflow engine for developing and running applications on Kubernetes.

* Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container.
* Run rich CI/CD pipelines using Docker-in-Docker, complex testing with built in artifact management, secret management and lifecycle management of dev/test resources.
* Run compute intensive jobs like data processing workflows or machine learning workflows in a fraction of the time using parallelize workflows.


## Why Argo?
* Argo is designed from the ground up for containers without the baggage and limitations of legacy VM and server-based environments.
* Argo is cloud agnostic and can run on any kubernetes cluster. Today we support Kubernetes on Minikube, AWS and GKE.
* Argo with Kubernetes puts a cloud-scale supercomputer at your fingertips.
* With Argo, you don’t need to install or learn other tools such as Jenkins, Chef, Cloud Formation... 

## Argo 2.0 Alpha 
Argo 2.0 is a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) which can run workflows using kubectl commands. Argo 2.0 is coming in December 2017. The alpha is available [here](https://github.com/argoproj/argo/blob/master/demo.md)

## Argo 1.1

#### Argo 1.1 Main Features
* Container-native workflows for Kubernetes.
  * Each step in the workflow is a container
  * Arbitrarily compose sub-workflows to create larger workflows
* Configuration as code (YAML for everything)
* Built-in support for artifacts, persistent volumes, and DNS/load-balancers/firewalls.
* DinD (Docker-in-Docker) out of the box. Run docker builds and other containers from within containerized workflows.
